        "To design a library management system using advanced OOP principles to manage books, members, and transactions effectively.\n",
        "Problem Statement:\n",
        "Create a system that allows users to manage books, track borrowed items, and handle membership registration. It should support adding, searching, and deleting books, as well as borrowing and returning them.\n",
        "Constraints & Rubrics:\n",
        "Must implement OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.\n",
        "User authentication must be secured (simple password-based).\n",
        "The interface should allow for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\n",
        "Use decorators to log actions performed by users.\n"
